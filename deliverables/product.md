#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

A mobile/tablet application that facilitates the resume-collection and categorization process for recruiters through digitizing and annotating paper resumes on-site and storing them in a categorized database. 

##### Problem:
After recruiting events, hiring managers don't have standardized criteria for resume categorization and prioritization, waste time sifting through papers, and can't always keep track of which recruiters annotated the specific resumes. 

For example, one recruiter had to sort through a lot of resumes while trying to understand what previous recruiters meant by their annotations. As a solution to this problem, the recruiter would use our application to see resumes annotated through a unified ranking criteria.

#####  Solution:
Allow recruiters to collect, annotate and categorize digital copies of the resumes.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?
Our target users are recruiters from companies whose task is to find potential candidates at career fairs and networking events.

We created a [User persona](https://app.xtensio.com/edit/ndwhpubh) to better represent out target users.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Our users would choose our product because its would solve many of their frustrations related to recruiting. Here are some of the problems they currently face:

|Problem                    | Our solution                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Transferring stacks of resumes is inefficient and impractical| Easily transfer resume information into a common database.| 
| Sifting through hundreds of uncategorized paper resumes after career fairs wastes time| Provides a digitally categorized stack of resumes based on recruiters' annotations |
| No standardized criteria on resume annotation makes it difficult for different recruiters to follow each others' notes | Can mark a resume with set of tags which categorizes it in the digital stack.
| Losing paper resumes | Has a digital copy of each resume in one place that is easily accessible
| Companies cannot keep track of resume analytics from career fairs and networking events, which hinders their ability to understand the applicant pool | Provides analytics from the career fair:<br> 1. Number of candidates who approached the companyâ€™s booth.<br> 2. The skills of candidates at the career fairs |

The main benefit of our product is that it saves time since the resumes can be easily organized and are stored in a single database. Recruiters can also discover new information such as analytics on the number of candidates and the overall qualifications of the candidate pool. Moreover, when a standardized criteria is applied to all resumes, any recruiter who is reading the resume can now better understand the annotations, and thus the qualifications, of the resume candidate. Without our app, it is more difficult to gain a holistic and comprehensive view of the candidate if there are no standardized criteria and the best way to gain analytics on the resumes is through manually counting them.

#### Highlights

1. We decided to transfer resumes to recruiters as pictures of physical versions, instead of making a separate user app that would store digital resumes from scanning a QR code. We went with this option, because we want our solution to be entirely recruiter-focused. Also, making one app, instead of two, is a more doable goal for our MVP. If we have time, we might still implement the user app later, as some recruiters mentioned that such functionality for students is desirable.

2. We decided that the users would be solely Recruiters. The alternative was to have students and recruiters both benefit from the process so students would not need to carry around paper resumes and they would be able to keep tabs on which career booths they dropped their resumes, get contact recruiter's contact information automatically. However, we decided that the problem is greater for Recruiters and that it was more ideal to only have one user base for the MVP to not overcomplicate our project.

3. We decided to use 2 separate boards on Trello, one for product backlog, another for sprint backlog. The alternative was using GitHub Issues, but it does not provide enough functionality, for example: creating tickets of what we need to complete.

4. We decided to use Slack for team communication. The alternative was Facebook Messenger, since it is something that everyone on the team uses everyday. But compared to Messenger, Slack allows to create organized threads for discussing different parts of the project. It also provides useful tools to developers, like: embedding code into posts, integration with Trello, GitHub, etc.

5. We needed to meet over the weekend and we decided to utilize digital resources in order to resolve time conflicts. For example, one team member who was not able to attend the meeting in person was able to join through online video call and participate as if they were present in the room. The alternative was to conduct a meeting entirely over online conference call, but we feel it is better to meet in person, if possible, because this makes discussion more natural.
