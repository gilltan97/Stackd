## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 11th 2017
 * Where: Gerstein Library B173
 
Prior to meeting we all read the deliverables documents and wrote down some ideas on how to fill it out. We went through 2 different meetings (one for product and iteration-01 documents). We discussed each question as a group and agreed on an answer that was typed by one of us. We also noticed that when discussing each question, we had important conversations about possible ideas and implementations of the product so we made sure to record minutes to preserve some of those conversation.

## Process - Reflection


#### Decisions that turned out well

* Process for generating and choosing ideas:
    * Initially, our process for generating ideas was not very good.
    * Discussed the problems together and brainstormed different domains and ideas on the spot
    * Discussed ideas with TAs and got feedback that they needed further work
    * We got into a deadlock, since none of our problems were thorough enough
    * Next meeting, each team member pitched a problem that they thought was worth solving, having done research into similar solutions
    * Other members questioned the pitched problems, discussed how impactful they are
    * Voted on the most important problem using ranked voting process where everyone votes for the problem they think is the best one, and the runner up. The problem with the most number of votes (independent of the rank given) wins.
    * [First meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FDd3tdwA6WKPucRehmdOpla6Pqw01Nwq3rnooIofGgU/edit?usp=sharing), [Second meeting minutes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QgJJjfX3aXyr4px0I3PjFAaKtPr8wVD2JZQI1iH43BY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Divided the team into groups and organized slack channels as such
    * Mock-ups were done by a group of two people, and they were discussed in a separate channel so we don’t flood the general channel with discussion about mock-ups
    * Each topic is discussed in a separate channel making it easier to find posts
    * Increased productivity by splitting off into groups during iteration so members of the group that did not need to be a part of the conversation did not need to be present
* Use Slack as a tool for communication: [link to the channel](https://netwerk301.slack.com).
    * To vote on a name for the project
    * Organize thoughts into channels
    * Sending bigger files
    * Ability to reply and discuss in sub-threads
    
* Utilize various meeting techniques to increase efficiency
    * video calling services to include members who cannot attend physically
    * Implemented some house rules about no interruptions/ constructive criticism/ make sure everyone has a voice
    * Take minutes each meeting
    * Agreed to prepare (i.e read documents) before meeting
    * Assigned Scrum Master and utilized Trello to control flow of each meeting
    * Taking breaks

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Deciding on a problem together
    * At first, we were generating solutions and app ideas that we wanted to make, we were not focusing on the problem
    * We were not well prepared, and tried  to generate ideas on the spot, which failed to produce any meaningful ideas
* Filling out the deliverables together
    * We worked together on all the deliverables, such as filling out the documents, but this prolonged meeting times, was inefficient, and caused sidetracking and prolonged debates
* Using different communication channels (messenger, slack) [include artifacts / screenshots of messenger and slacks]
    * People had their ideas scattered all over the place, it was hard to search for anything

#### Planned changes

* Make agenda for all upcoming meetings including which topics to discuss at each meeting as a general calendar and add times to every task on agenda
* Use Slack only, stop using Messenger
* Keep an open mind to other people’s criticism and do not take criticism personally. Try and express criticism in a constructive way with evidence rather than shut down other people’s ideas. Stick to your opinion and back it up if you believe it is the best decision for the team.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
* Decided to build an android app to solve the problem we agreed on
* Decided on the workflow of our product (with the help of [mockups](https://invis.io/RWDW4H9YH#/257682394_Sign_Ins))
* Analyzed our target audience and their needs/frustrations, talked to actual recruiters
* Decided hoe exactly our product solves the recruiters' needs

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
* Figuring out the API
* Overall gui flow of app (still debatable)
* More specialized roles leading to clearer tasks and goals

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Create concrete tasks on Trello and assign them to each member and use the stand-up meetings to discuss the progress on these tasks
* Improve and add more details to the UX and consult more HCI and recruiters for valuable feedback
